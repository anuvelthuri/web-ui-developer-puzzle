## Dev Puzzle Code Review

1. Code Smells, Problems
   - Replace subscription usage with async pipe in markup to avoid memory leaks in book-search.component
   - Using date pipe in markup instead of custom function
   - Improved code coverage

2. Accessibility changes
   - added alt texts to buttons
   - improved color contrats to satisfy accesibility
